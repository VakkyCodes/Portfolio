RESUME FOLDER INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To make your resume download feature work:

1. Save your resume as "Vakratund_Resume.pdf" in this folder
2. Make sure it's a PDF file for best compatibility
3. The resume will be downloadable and viewable online

Current file structure should be:
assets/resume/Vakratund_Resume.pdf

Note: Until you add your actual resume PDF file, the download links will not work.
You can replace "Vakratund_Resume.pdf" in the HTML file with any filename you prefer.
